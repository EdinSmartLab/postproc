PostProc: A post-processing package for my PhD CFD simulations
============================================================

This library has the goal of gathering all the python scripts I wrote for post-processing data from my Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations I run for my PhD. By making it public I hope someone else can find this useful as well.

This repository contains the ``postproc`` package provided with the following tools

- ``cylinder_forces``: a set of functions which allow to extract useful information from the forces on a cylinder provided with a time series of the lift force.
